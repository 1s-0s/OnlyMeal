<h2>Problem:-</h2>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic is threatening the long-cherished food security of India. It has impacted all four aspects, namely 'availability, access, stability, and utilization' of food. To meet the requirement of these four pillars become problematic in this pandemic situation. The improper availability and high food rate is not just a problem of the lower section of society but also become the part of middle and higher section of society too.</p>

<h2>Solution:-</h2>
<p>To overcome the mentioned problem our team came up with the solution to minimize the food wastage by making it available to deprived ones in this pandemic situation at zero cost with minimal efforts.</p>

<h2>Implementation:-</h2>
<ul>
<li>Developing a web application on MERN stack that provides a two-way interactive interface for the donors and the receivers.</li>
<li>The donors will be able to upload the food information(quantity, type, category and state) and pickup location.
<li>The receiver will be able to view the list of food items and can avail it as per their requirements.
<li>The receiver will have to provide their contact details before availing the food items so that the donor gets the confirmation via email.
<li>Stored all the food data in the form of REST API.
<li>The application will maintain the food expiry dynamically record which makes food item inaccessible from the available list after the expiry time exceeds.
</ul>
